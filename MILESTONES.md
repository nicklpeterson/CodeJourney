## MILESTONE 1

For project 2, we are planning to analysis a git repository and display the result as a 2d platform game for the user to explorer. For the git repository, we will analysis all the commits based on the properties such as the branch, no. of lines that were added, no. of files that were deleted and more. Once we finish the analysis, we will assign sprites such as blocks, coins, items, and even monsters to the commit based on the analysis result. Eventually we will create the game map using the sprites assigned to all the commits. The first commit will be the start of the map and the last commit will be the end of the map. Our goal is to let the user control the character in game and explore the map that were created from their git repository.<br/><br/>

We have talked with Amir and got some feedbacks on our project 2 idea. The TA suggested that our visualization idea of making a game may not be helpful at analyzing the git repository. And we should do some more researches on the existing git visualization tool.

For the next week, we are planning to do the following:

 - Do more researches on git visualization 
 - Do more researches on tools that can help us analysis the git repository
 - Finalize the project 2 idea and provide better description on its feature  
 - Finalize the language & framework we want to use for project 2
